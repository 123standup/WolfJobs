# WolfJobs
Sometimes, it could happen that a student who has an on-campus job fails to attend it because of some emergency or urgent requirement, then in such situations, we might need extra hands to compensate for the loss of one worker. Thus, to get help on such short notice, we intend to design a temporary job portal where students can view several temporary job postings and voluntarily offer to work on them.

WOLFJOBS is an easy and convenient search application for students to find their temporary jobs and for the recruiters to find the right candidate in an urgent situation. Job seekers can register with the application and update their details and skill set.  Students can search for available jobs and apply for them accordingly. The manager will then pick the best candidate by checking the eligibility criteria.
